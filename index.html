    <h1>Croissants</h1>
    <p>It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
    yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with
    butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating.
    The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
